# Color Hoarding with Licia He 

If Licia can only have one passion project, it would be hoarding colorful art supplies.

## Overview
[Licia He](https://www.eyesofpanda.com/) is a generative artist who loves collecting art supplies. Since her first encounter with a drawing robot, Licia has been focused on bridging her digital and physical painting practices through plotters. 

She started working on plotter-based generative watercolor pieces in 2019. This digital-physical art practice continues to give her many opportunities (and excuses) to expand her art supply collection. As her ink and watercolor collection growing significantly, she found it increasingly difficult to organize and pick colors. She naturally gravitates towards her favorites and left many beautiful bottles of ink untouched. 

"That's not ideal!" Licia is determined to try out all wonderful combinations of color, therefore decided to build a color management system for her growing color collection. **Color Hoarding with Licia He** is this management system. 

## About the System 
The system has a couple of goals:
1. Display color swatches of physical colors (ink, watercolor, and etc.) in Licia's collection. 
2. Organize color based on their properties. e.g., brand, type, hue. 
3. Rule-based color palette generation.
4. Manual color palette selection. 

Maybe more features in the future.
