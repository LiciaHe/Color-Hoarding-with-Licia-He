# Color Hoarding with Licia He

If Licia can only have one passion project, it would be hoarding colorful art supplies.

This is Licia's repository for sharing her color collections and experiments.

## [Color Rules Generator](tutorial/Color_Rules_Generator.md)

[Color Rule Generator](https://www.eyesofpanda.com/project/color_rules_generator/) is a color scheme-creating tool designed for generative artists. In contrast to tools that assist in curating sets of colors, this tool helps users to create color-generating rules.

## License and Note

This is a one-woman project growing purely out of passion. It's not affiliated with any of brand/company/manufacturer included in the collection. The color might look significantly different if they were swatched or processed in other ways.

I decided to open source this project, including all the data (spreadsheet + color swatches), the code I used to process the data (in Python), and the web-based system (in Javascript).

If you would like to support me or this project, please consider supporting organizations/movements that help women and non-binary artists & technologists. I recommend donating to organizations like [AnitaB Institute](https://anitab.org/) and [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/).

I hope you enjoy it.
