# Color Combo Generator 

[Color Combo Generator](#todo) is a color scheme creating tool designed for generative artists. In contrast to tools that assist the curation of sets of colors, this tool help users to create color-generating rules.

## Getting Started 

The Color Combo Generator helps users to create a set of **color generating rules.**  Each rule is essentially a section of the 3-dimentional space formed by Hue, Saturation, and Lightness (known as [HSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV)).  Users create rules by setting a **selection range** for each of these dimensions. 

### Step 0: Adjust Lightness

The left most panel indicates the lightness level. The lightest value (0%) is on the bottom and the darkest value (100%) is on the top. Drag yellow bars to adjust the lightness range for the current rule. 

### Step 1: Define Hue and Saturation Range

Define the Hue and Saturation range by dragging a rectangle on the main (rainbow) display. A rule information panel will appear on the right. You can view and adjust the precise setting on the information panel. 

### Step 2 Simulate Color Sampling from One Rule.
